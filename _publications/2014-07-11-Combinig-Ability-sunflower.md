excerpt: 'The additive components of genetic variance played the main role in the inheritance of oil content, which was confirmed by below one GCA/SCA ratio. The main role in the inheritance of seed yield was played by the non additive gene effects. The lines CMS 67A, CMS234A and P145R having highly significant gca effects for both seed yield and oil content should be used in future hybrid breeding programme to develop productive hybrids w.r.t. oil and seed yield'

Abstract: The additive components of genetic variance played the main role in the inheritance of oil content, which was confirmed by below one GCA/SCA ratio. The main role in the inheritance of seed yield was played by the non additive gene effects. The lines CMS 67A, CMS234A and P145R having highly significant gca effects for both seed yield and oil content should be used in future hybrid breeding programme to develop productive hybrids w.r.t. oil and seed yield
