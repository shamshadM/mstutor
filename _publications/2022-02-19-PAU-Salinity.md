title: "Salt stress genotypic response: Relative tolerance of wheat cultivars to salinity"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022-02-19-PAU-Salinity
excerpt: 'The commercial wheat genotypes released for cultivation under timely sown irrigated conditions in Punjab along with known salt tolerant genotypes and few advance breeding lines were evaluated for salt stress tolerance at seedling stage under simulated stress conditions and at adult plant stage in actual saline fields at Rattakhera, Sri Mukatsar Sahib (Punjab), to find out the best suitable wheat variety for the salt affected areas. Twelve wheat varieties, seven advance breeding lines, one wheat genotype popular in salt stressed regions of Punjab and Kharchia, a universal donor for stress tolerance to salt were tested. PBW 765 and PBW 780 had highest tolerance among advance germplasm, HD 3086, HD 2967, KRL 210 could be categorized in one group whereas PBW 725 showed moderate tolerance to salt stress. These identified genotypes are most suitable for regions having moderate to high salinity stress as these were less affected due to salinity.'

Abstract: The commercial wheat genotypes released for cultivation under timely sown irrigated conditions in Punjab along with known salt tolerant genotypes and few advance breeding lines were evaluated for salt stress tolerance at seedling stage under simulated stress conditions and at adult plant stage in actual saline fields at Rattakhera, Sri Mukatsar Sahib (Punjab), to find out the best suitable wheat variety for the salt affected areas. Twelve wheat varieties, seven advance breeding lines, one wheat genotype popular in salt stressed regions of Punjab and Kharchia, a universal donor for stress tolerance to salt were tested. PBW 765 and PBW 780 had highest tolerance among advance germplasm, HD 3086, HD 2967, KRL 210 could be categorized in one group whereas PBW 725 showed moderate tolerance to salt stress. These identified genotypes are most suitable for regions having moderate to high salinity stress as these were less affected due to salinity.
