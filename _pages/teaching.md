Research plays a central role in my teaching as students improve their analytical skills and master the tools of data analysis through hands-on experience.I have taught undergraduate courses on Plant Breeding and Genetics. I taught the graduate statistics lab for Advanced Topics in Agricultural Data Science, where my work was recognized by the by the Department’s. I am worked instructor various institutions, which help me to develops evidence-based methods for teaching “essential data and computational skills for conducting efficient, open, and reproducible research.”
