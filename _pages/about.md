I am from Malerkotla Punjab and work as a [Post-Doctoral Researcher](https://tigr2ess.globalfood.cam.ac.uk/staff/dr-mohammad-shamshad) in the **[Transforming India's Green Revolution by Research and Empowerment for Sustainable food Supplies](https://tigr2ess.globalfood.cam.ac.uk/fps/FP3)** at the [Plant Breeding and Genetics, PAU](https://www.pau.edu/coa/index.php?_act=manageDepartments&DO=viewDepartment&intLinkID=9) in Ludhiana, India.

My work focus on the development and evaluation of high-yielding, diseases resistance, and abiotic stress tolerance crops. `shamshad.in` is my blog to keep track of my projects and different HOW TOs related to data and tech. 

I am passionate about Agriculture and cutting-edge technologies. I have a solid understanding and rigorous hands-on experience in field of plant breeding, quantitative genetics, computational biology and high throughput phenotyping, which I earned during my academic and research work with plant breeder/geneticists, bioinformaticist, and pathologists in my undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral career. 

I have professional Expertise in Plant Breeding, Quantitative Genetics, Genomics and computational biology. I am passionate about Experimental Design, Data Analysis and Visualization using R, SAS, jmp SAS, python, UNIX/Linux, HTML/CSS, Git and GitHub. I have worked experience in DNA extraction, PCR, Gel Electrophoresis, and Microscopy.
