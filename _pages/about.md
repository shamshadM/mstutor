### About me

I work as a post-doctoral researcher in the **[Transforming India's Green Revolution by Research and Empowerment for Sustainable food Supplies](https://tigr2ess.globalfood.cam.ac.uk/fps/FP3)** at the [Plant Breeding and Genetics, PAU](https://www.pau.edu/coa/index.php?_act=manageDepartments&DO=viewDepartment&intLinkID=9) in Ludhiana, India.

My work focus on the developement and evaluation of high yielding, diseases resistance, and abiotic stress tolerance crops. `shamshad.in` is my personal blog to keep track of my projects and different HOWTOs related to data and tech. 

I am passionate about Agriculture and cutting edge technologies. I have solid understanding and rigorous hands on experience in field of plant breeding, quatitative genetics, computational biology and hight throughput phenotyping, which I earned during my academic and reaserach work with plant breeder/geneticists, bioinformaticists, pathologist in my undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral career. 

I have professional Expertise in Plant Breeding, Quatitative Genetics, Geneomics and computational biology. I strong skills in Experimental Design, Data Analysis and Visualization in: R, SAS, jmp SAS, python, UNIX/Linux, HTML/CSS, Git and GitHub.
