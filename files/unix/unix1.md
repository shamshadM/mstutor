## Introduction
This briefing is intended to provide the learner with a basic overview of essential Unix/Linux commands. This allow them to navigate a file system and move, copy, and edit files. We will also introduce a brief overview of some `power` commands in Unix.

## Why Unix?
Unix allows direct communication with the computer via a terminal, hence being very interactive and giving the user direct control over the computer resources. Unix also gives users the ability to share data and programs among one another. The unix operating system has been evolved around since 1969 back, when there were no such a thing as graphical user infrence. There are several different shell languages. What we will be using in this course is a popular shell flavor called [BASH](https://www.howtogeek.com/68563/htg-explains-what-are-the-differences-between-linux-shells/)
