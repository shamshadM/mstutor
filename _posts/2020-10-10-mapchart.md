**MapChart** is a free software to plot publishing quality genetic linkage maps as well as QTLs. This software was developed at **Wageningen University** by **Roeland E. Voorrips**  and can be downloaded at this <a href="https://www.wur.nl/en/show/Mapchart.htm"> link </a>.

In this tutorial, We are going to learn how to prepare `input` files and plot the genetic linkage map in the `MapChart` software. For detail information, please read this article at this <a href="https://www.wur.nl/en/show/Mapchart.htm">link</a>. The software also contains a descriptive manual, please consult it for detailed information.

## Step 1: Preparing the Input file 
In `MS Excel` or any relevant software, create the input file as shown in the images below. **Please Note** third column is optional, which can be used to color code the marker names and position. In this example, I have used `C2` to color some markers in the `red`.

</p>

***

## Step 2: Running the MapChart software 

### 1.1 Importing input file

Open `MapChart` and copy the input data from `MS Excel`, and paste in the window as shown below.
Please note, if you have data for multiple linkage groups or chromosomes then in the same window add those information starting from different line and make sure to have the correct the chromosome number for each `Group`.

</p>

***

### Step: 1.2 Plot maps
Once the input data are loaded, click `chart` to plot the map. Follow the steps shown in the below figure to run this step. Once the plot is generated, it can be copied and pasted or saved as a desired format.

</p>

***

### Step: 1.3 Formating the plot (optional)
Under the `Tools` click `chart options` one can format the plot by choosing the given parameters.

### 2.0 Extra: Adding QTL results with Linkage Map
To add the QTL scan information by the Linkage map plot, two files are needed:
<ul>
 <li> Graph file (*.txt)-- It contains the QTL scan information such as: Linkage group or chromosome, LOD score, markers name and their position </li>
 <li> MapChart datafile (*.mct) </li>
</ul>
Please make sure to **save** the above two files in the same directory.

#### 2.1 Graph file 
An example of graph file is shown below snippet. It should be saved a text file (.txt)
The first line of the should contain the below listed headers/column names in the same order:
<ol>
 <li> Map = the marker position </li>
 <li> Group = Linkage group or chromosome </li>
 <li> LOD = LOD scores of the markers from QTL scan </li>
 <li> Locus = Marker names </li>
</ol>

#### 2.2 MapChart file (*.mct)
An example file of mapchart file is shown in snippet below.

In this file, one can indicate the most significant marker and QTL intervals. For example, in the below snippet, notice that under group 3, I have added t=`***` by marker **3_17950996** to highlight the significant marker, similarly, added **b** by markers **3_14850509** and **3_19690734** to indicate the qtl intervals.

Further, please read the **notes** (lines beginning with `**`;`**`) in the snippet below to learn more about how one add x- and y-axis scale, draw line for LOD threshold and positon of candidate gene/s.
